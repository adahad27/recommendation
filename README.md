This project was started May 2025.
The (lofty) goal of this project is to create a recommender system that uses both collaborative and content filtering to create a hybrid filtering algorithm.
This project will focus on 3 mediums, movies, books, and anime. (Those were the only datasets that I could find on Kaggle or elsewhere)

The core algorithm and code for the accompanying web application will be hosted on this github page.
